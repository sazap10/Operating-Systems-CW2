FileSystem in a File
====================

Disclaimer: I think this code works correctly, but if you think you
might have found a bug, let me <m.handley@cs.ucl.ac.uk> know.  


Errata:
------

 - The superblock metadata is not updated as it should be.
 - The primary superblock is not cloned into the secondary superblocks.

Neither of these should present a problem.


Programs
========

The files in this directory contain the C source code to several
programs for creating and manipulating a filesystem in a file.

Four programs will be built if you type "make":

  jfs_format: creates a new empty filesystem in a file.

  jfs_mkdir: creates a new directory within a filesystem in a file.

  jfs_ls: lists verbosely all the files and directories in the filesystem.

  jfs_copyin: copies a file from the external filesystem into the
     virtual one.

  jfs_copyout: copies a file from the virtual filesystem to the
     external one.

  jfs_fsck: checks the filesystem is internally consistent.


"make" will also try to compile jfs_rm that you are supposed to
write, but as there's no source code for them here, it will currently
fail.


Files
=====

The files provided are:

Makefile
	Used by the "make" (or gmake) utility to compile and link all
	the programs.  On Solaris, gmake works and make doesn't.

fs_disk.h
	Basic definitions used to emulate a virtual disk within a file.
fs_disk.c
	C functions used to emulate a virtual disk within a file.
	The main functions you will need to use are:
		mount_disk_image
		unmount_disk_image
		read_block
		write_block

jfs_common.h
	Basic definitions used in the filesystem, including all the
	filesystem structures and many constant definitions.
jfs_common.c
	C functions that provide core filesystem functionality that is
	used by many programs.  You may find many functions from this
	file useful.

jfs_format.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_format program.

jfs_mkdir.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_mkdir program.

jfs_ls.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_ls program.

jfs_copyin.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_copyin program.

jfs_copyout.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_copyout program.

jfs_fsck.c
	C functions used to build the jfs_fsck program.
